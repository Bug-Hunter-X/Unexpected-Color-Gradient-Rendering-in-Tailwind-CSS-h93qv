```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```

//In this specific example, the solution involves double-checking all the color values and class names in your tailwind setup. The solution would involve making sure that the `from-blue-500` and `to-purple-500` are correct and that there are no other conflicting styles overriding the gradient.
