# Unexpected Color Gradient Rendering in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates a bug related to unexpected color gradient rendering in Tailwind CSS. The gradient does not appear as expected, showing only one color or an unexpected color combination.

## Bug Description

When applying a gradient using the `bg-gradient-to-r` utility class along with color values (e.g., `from-blue-500` and `to-purple-500`), the resulting gradient may not render correctly.  The expected outcome is a smooth color transition from blue to purple; however, the actual output might be a single color or a different, unexpected gradient.

## Solution

The issue might stem from several factors:

1. **Incorrect Color Values:** Verify that the Tailwind CSS color palette includes the specified colors (`blue-500` and `purple-500`). If the color values are incorrect or undefined, the gradient won't render correctly.
2. **Conflicting Styles:** Check for any CSS rules that might override the Tailwind CSS gradient styles.  Make sure that there are no conflicting styles present which are unintentionally interfering with the gradient application.
3. **Missing or Incorrect Configuration:** Double-check your Tailwind CSS configuration to ensure that it is correctly set up and that the necessary plugins are installed and configured. If you are using a custom theme or configuration, make sure it's properly applied and does not conflict with the gradient functionality.
4. **Browser Compatibility:** Test your code in different browsers to see if this issue is isolated to a specific browser or a browser version. Test on multiple browsers to rule out any browser-specific rendering inconsistencies.
5. **Typographical Errors:** Carefully check your class names and values for any typos, such as `bg-gradient-to-r` being misspelled or incorrect color values.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and run it in your browser.
3. Observe the unexpected gradient behavior.
